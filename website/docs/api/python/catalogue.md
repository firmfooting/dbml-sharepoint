# `dbml_sharepoint.catalogue`

*Packaging: the shipped solution templates, as data*

The shipped solution templates, as data the wizard can offer.

One `Solution` per directory under `solutions/`. Everything here is
read-only discovery: nothing in this module writes, validates or deploys.

Discovered by glob, never by roster. A hardcoded list of names fails open.
A new template is simply never offered, and every test stays green saying
so. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds the same set the same way, and
`test_template_standard.py` derives its conformance cases from it.

The directory is located the way `templating.py` locates the Jinja
templates, relative to this file, inside the installed package. That is
the whole reason the templates were moved here: the audience for the wizard
is somebody who ran `uvx dbml-sharepoint` and has no checkout.

### `SOLUTIONS_DIR`

```python
SOLUTIONS_DIR = Path("dbml_sharepoint/solutions")
```

### `SCHEMA_RELPATH`

```python
SCHEMA_RELPATH = Path("10-design/schema.dbml")
```

### `MAPPING_RELPATH`

```python
MAPPING_RELPATH = Path("20-configure/mapping.yaml")
```

### `RELEASE_RELPATH`

```python
RELEASE_RELPATH = Path("20-configure/release.yaml")
```

### `PLACEHOLDER_SITE_URL`

```python
PLACEHOLDER_SITE_URL = 'https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/your-site'
```

### `UnknownSolutionError`

Named solution does not exist. Carries the available names.

A `LookupError` rather than a bare `ValueError` so a caller can
distinguish "no such template" from "this template is malformed", which
fail in completely different ways and want different messages.

### `Solution`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Solution:
    id: str
    title: str
    summary: str
    detail: str
    lists: tuple[str, ...]
    prefix: str
    root: Path
```

One shipped list family.

Frozen because the catalogue is read once and handed to a UI; nothing
downstream has any business editing a template's identity.

### `available_solutions`

```python
def available_solutions() -> list[dbml_sharepoint.catalogue.Solution]
```

Every shipped family, ordered by id.

A directory only counts when it carries a `schema.dbml` at the family
standard's path. That keeps a stray directory -- a leftover `build/`,
an editor's backup -- from appearing in the picker as a template the
user can choose and then fail to deploy.

### `load_solution`

```python
def load_solution(name: str) -> dbml_sharepoint.catalogue.Solution
```

One family by directory name, or `UnknownSolutionError`.
